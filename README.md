# React Monorepo Platform üèï

A batteries included monorepo starter to jumpstart application development.

## Getting Started

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mwood23/react-monorepo-starter.git

cd react-monorepo-starter

# Installs deps and builds all packages and projects
yarn bootstrap

yarn <PROJECT-YOU-WANT-TO-RUN>:dev
```

### Workspaces

There is a workspace available for each project located in [`.vscode/platform.code-workspace`](./.vscode/platform.code-workspace). It is helpful to run this so you can receive topical search results that ignore built files or test coverage directories. It also changes your title bar color so you can easily find this project compared to other coding windows you have open.
